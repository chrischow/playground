# Playground
A simple TypeScript setup for experimentation.

## Setup
Installation:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage
1. Add any code you want to test in the `src` folder
2. Import the main function into `src/index.ts`
3. Run the script - Node will watch for changes and re-run the code

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
